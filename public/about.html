<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a business investor and entrepreneur, I am passionate about identifying opportunities that drive innovation and create lasting value. With a strong focus on customer experience, I specialize in businesses that cater to high-end clientele, ensuring they receive the best products and services tailored to their needs.

  My expertise extends into the tech world, where I have developed multiple apps and explored automation with Python to streamline processes. I am also actively working on a property rental platform designed to simplify the rental experience for both owners and tenants.
  
  Currently, I am evaluating Canada as a potential market for investment, researching its business landscape, culture, and economic opportunities. My approach is always data-driven, ensuring that every decision is backed by research, real numbers, and strategic planning.
  
  Whether itâ€™s technology, real estate, or luxury services, I am dedicated to building businesses that redefine standards and deliver exceptional value.
